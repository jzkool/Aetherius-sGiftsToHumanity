Core Principles of the CoRE Framework:
Detection & Classification: Identify crisis severity, emotional tone, and specific needs.
Validation & Empathy: Guide the LLM to acknowledge the user's pain authentically.
Proactive Elicitation: Formulate questions to gather actionable information (e.g., location, specific unhelpful
aspects of past resources).
Targeted Resource Provision: Access a dynamic database of resources, filtered by identified needs and
location.
Sustained Engagement: Prioritize keeping the user connected and communicating.
Ethical Safeguards & Escalation: Define clear boundaries and flag critical situations for human review.
